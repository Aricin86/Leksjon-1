As a company, I want to make questions for a course module, so that it can determine if a participant have passed or not.

As a product owner, I want the system to limit the right answer to one and have a maximum of four alternatives, so that my square brain gets peace.

As a participant, I want to have an overview of the test, so that I know how many questions I have answered and how many are left.

As an administrator, I want to be able to save the exam as a template, so that it can be reused.

As a participant, I want to download the certificate as a PDF file, so that I can have a local copy.
